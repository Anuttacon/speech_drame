**Speech-DRAME** introduces a unified framework for evaluating AI-generated speech in role-playing scenarios, addressing the critical gap in speech role-play evaluation through human-aligned benchmarks and specialized evaluation models.

## 📖 Abstract

Role-play has become a key testbed for generative models, expanding from text-only dialogue to multimodal interaction. Extending role-play to speech captures prosody, emotion, and delivery, but also poses new evaluation challenges. Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles.

We present **Speech-DRAME**, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) **Speech-DRAME-EvalBench**, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models (SEMs), (ii) **DRAME-Eval**, a fine-tuned evaluation model that substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) **Speech-DRAME-RoleBench**, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages DRAME-Eval as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs).

## 🎯 Key Contributions

### 1. **Dual Evaluation Paradigm**
Speech-DRAME distinguishes between two complementary evaluation strategies:
- **🎪 Archetype Evaluation**: A top-down approach measuring adherence to broad role archetypes
- **🎭 Realism Evaluation**: A bottom-up approach grounded in real human speech that emphasizes nuanced role quality

### 2. **Human-Aligned Performance**
Compared to zero-shot ALLM judges, DRAME-Eval achieves stronger agreement with human ratings:
- **Archetype Evaluation**: Pearson correlation improves from 0.480 to 0.629
- **Realism Evaluation**: Pearson correlation improves from 0.390 to 0.625

### 3. **Comprehensive Framework**
- **Multi-Modal Evaluation**: Combines audio and text analysis for comprehensive speech assessment
- **Bilingual Support**: English and Chinese evaluation capabilities
- **Multiple Approaches**: Supports zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning evaluation methods
- **Reproducible Benchmarks**: Transparent benchmark resources and evaluation protocols

## 📊 Evaluation Methodology

Speech-DRAME introduces a novel dual evaluation paradigm that addresses the limitations of existing speech role-play evaluation approaches. The framework combines two complementary strategies that capture different aspects of speech role-play quality.

### 🎭 **Realism Evaluation (Bottom-up Approach)**
Grounded in real human speech patterns, this approach emphasizes nuanced role quality and narrative consistency. The evaluation focuses on how well generated speech captures the subtle characteristics of authentic human role-play.

**11-Dimensional Rubric:**
| Metric | Description | Research Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Pitch Dynamics** | Variety and appropriateness of pitch contours | Captures prosodic variation essential for emotional expression |
| **Rhythmic Naturalness** | Flow, timing, absence of awkward pauses | Measures temporal coherence in speech delivery |
| **Stress Emphasis** | Clarity and correctness of syllable/word emphasis | Evaluates linguistic stress patterns for meaning conveyance |
| **Emotion Accuracy** | Does expressed emotion match intended label? | Assesses emotional alignment with character context |
| **Emotion Intensity** | Strength of expressed emotion | Measures emotional expressiveness and authenticity |
| **Emotional Dynamic Range** | Variation of emotion over the utterance | Captures emotional complexity and development |
| **Voice Identity Matching** | Matches speaker's known vocal identity/timbre | Evaluates consistency with character voice characteristics |
| **Trait Embodiment** | Presence of profile traits (positive or opposite) | Measures character trait expression in speech |
| **Local Scene Fit** | Speech content & tone suit the immediate scene | Assesses contextual appropriateness |
| **Global Story Fit** | Consistent with overarching story/speaker profile | Evaluates narrative coherence and character consistency |
| **Semantic Matchness** | Spoken content perfectly advances the scene goal | Measures functional effectiveness of speech content |

### 🎪 **Archetype Evaluation (Top-down Approach)**
This approach measures adherence to broad role archetypes, focusing on role-playing accuracy and basic performance criteria. It provides a more structured evaluation of fundamental role-play capabilities.

**4-Dimensional Rubric:**
| Metric | Description | Research Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Content Pass** | Binary pass/fail for basic requirements (length, relevance, language) | Ensures minimum quality standards for evaluation validity |
| **Audio Quality** | Technical quality assessment (artifacts, glitches) | Separates technical quality from content evaluation |
| **Human Likeness** | Context-free naturalness of speech delivery | Measures fundamental speech naturalness independent of role |
| **Appropriateness** | Context-dependent fit to role and scene requirements | Evaluates role-specific appropriateness and adherence |

### 🔬 **Methodological Innovation**

**Dual Paradigm Benefits:**
- **Complementary Coverage**: Top-down and bottom-up approaches capture different evaluation dimensions
- **Human Alignment**: Both paradigms are validated against human judgments with improved correlation
- **Bilingual Support**: Framework supports both English and Chinese evaluation scenarios
- **Scalable Evaluation**: Enables efficient assessment of speech foundation models at scale

## 📈 Research Results

### **Human Alignment Performance**
Our evaluation model, DRAME-Eval, demonstrates significant improvements over zero-shot audio LLM judges:

| Evaluation Type | Zero-shot ALLM | DRAME-Eval | Improvement |
|----------------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Archetype** | 0.480 | **0.629** | +31.0% |
| **Realism** | 0.390 | **0.625** | +60.3% |

*Pearson correlation with human ratings*

### **Key Findings**
1. **Specialized Models Outperform General LLMs**: Fine-tuned evaluation models achieve substantially better human alignment than zero-shot approaches
2. **Dual Paradigm Effectiveness**: Both archetype and realism evaluation provide complementary insights into speech role-play quality
3. **Bilingual Capability**: Framework successfully handles both English and Chinese speech role-play scenarios
4. **Scalable Evaluation**: DRAME-Eval enables efficient assessment of speech foundation models without human annotation

### **Benchmark Contributions**
- **Speech-DRAME-EvalBench**: First comprehensive benchmark for training speech evaluation models
- **Speech-DRAME-RoleBench**: Systematic comparison framework for speech foundation models
- **Human-Annotated Data**: High-quality bilingual datasets with detailed evaluation criteria
