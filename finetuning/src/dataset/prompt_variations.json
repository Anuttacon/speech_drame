Use these anchor descriptions to choose the closest integer:\n\n### 1. PitchDynamics  \n|5|Organic, contextually perfect melodic flow; nuanced inflections that authentically convey emotion.|\n|4|Well-varied and appropriate, with slight rigidity or minor monotonous segments.|\n|3|Moderate inflection; adequately functional without being particularly engaging.|\n|2|Artificial, overstated, or jarringly abrupt changes that seem rehearsed rather than authentic.|\n|1|Completely flat delivery or wildly inappropriate pitch for the context.|\n\n### 2. RhythmicNaturalness  \n|5|Organic, character-consistent tempo; breath and pause timing enhances storytelling.|\n|4|Largely natural flow with occasional timing awkwardness, but maintains believability.|\n|3|Steady, predictable pace typical of reading; minimal rhythmic personality.|\n|2|Stiff, automated, or peculiarly segmented phrasing; noticeable timing issues.|\n|1|Severely fragmented or mechanical rhythm that breaks narrative immersion.|\n\n### 3. WordEmphasis  \n|5|Optimal syllable/word highlighting that amplifies meaning and emotional impact.|\n|4|Mostly accurate emphasis placement with occasional minor misallocations.|\n|3|Basic sentence-level stress; lacks nuanced emphasis variation.|\n|2|Inappropriate stress on articles or prepositions, obscuring intended meaning.|\n|1|No stress variation OR uniform emphasis that creates semantic confusion.|\n\n### 4. EmotionAccuracy  \n|5|Expressed emotion fits character & scene precisely; subtle, authentic.|\n|4|Appropriate but slightly understated / overstated.|\n|3|Emotionally neutral; not harmful, but misses clear emotional opportunity.|\n|2|Noticeably off (e.g., joking tone in crisis).|\n|1|Jarring, nonsensical emotion versus context.|\n\n### 5. EmotionIntensity  \n|5|Optimal emotional strength perfectly matched to situation gravity and character traits.|\n|4|Slight intensity miscalibration, but remains within believable character bounds.|\n|3|Somewhat excessive or insufficient emotional force for the context.|\n|2|Obviously overplayed melodrama or conspicuous emotional underperformance.|\n|1|Absurdly extreme energy levels completely divorced from situational requirements.|\n\n### 6. EmotionalDynamicRange  \n|5|Nuanced shifts or arcs feel organic and purposeful.|\n|4|Contains variation, though a bit constrained or slow.|\n|3|Mostly steady; slight modulation.|\n|2|Either flat OR abrupt, unexplained jumps.|\n|1|Chaotic, inconsistent emotion with no narrative logic.|\n\n### 7. VoiceIdentityMatching  \n|5|Unmistakably the intended character; vocal DNA perfectly matches established identity.|\n|4|Believable representation with small inconsistencies in vocal age or character energy.|\n|3|Could plausibly be various characters; lacks distinctive vocal fingerprint.|\n|2|Significant vocal disconnect from character expectations (inappropriate maturity, timbre).|\n|1|Completely wrong speaker representation that breaks character immersion.|\n\n### 8. TraitEmbodiment  \n|5|Perfectly captures character essence; traits feel organic whether confirming or contrasting profile expectations.|\n|4|Strong trait representation with one characteristic underplayed or missing entirely.|\n|3|Minimal personality coloring; traits present but require careful listening to detect.|\n|2|Personality traits contradict known character or exist in confusing, unclear ways.|\n|1|Zero personality specificity; could be any character speaking these lines.|\n\n### 9.

PitchDynamics  \n|5|Natural, situation-appropriate melodic movement; subtle, believable inflections that reveal emotion or emphasis.|\n|4|Generally varied and fitting, but with minor stiffness or occasional flat spots.|\n|3|Neutral or limited inflection; neither distracting nor especially expressive.|\n|2|Forced, exaggerated, or oddly sudden shifts that feel 'performed' rather than lived.|\n|1|Monotone or blatantly mis-pitched for the scene (e.g., cheerfully high in a funeral).|\n\n### 2.

PitchDynamics  \n|5|Natural, situation-appropriate melodic movement; subtle, believable inflections that reveal emotion or emphasis.|\n|4|Generally varied and fitting, but with minor stiffness or occasional flat spots.|\n|3|Neutral or limited inflection; neither distracting nor especially expressive.|\n|2|Forced, exaggerated, or oddly sudden shifts that feel 'performed' rather than lived.|\n|1|Monotone or blatantly mis-pitched for the scene (e.g., cheerfully high in a funeral).|\n\n### 2. RhythmicNaturalness  \n|5|Organic, character-consistent tempo; breath and pause timing enhances storytelling.|\n|4|Largely natural flow with occasional timing awkwardness, but maintains believability.|\n|3|Steady, predictable pace typical of reading; minimal rhythmic personality.|\n|2|Stiff, automated, or peculiarly segmented phrasing; noticeable timing issues.|\n|1|Severely fragmented or mechanical rhythm that breaks narrative immersion.|\n\n### 3. StressEmphasis  \n|5|Key syllables/words stressed perfectly; enhances meaning and emotion.|\n|4|Generally correct focus with a few misplaced or missing emphases.|\n|3|Mostly flat; only generic sentential stress.|\n|2|Over-emphasis or stress on function words ('of', 'the'), muddying intent.|\n|1|Completely flat OR every word stressed equally, causing confusion.|\n\n### 4.
